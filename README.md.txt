This is a manual reconstruction project developed in Python and is used to create XML files 
to be viewed and processed with TexGen which is an open source software developed in University of Nottingham for modelling
of textlile composites.
The main file uses X,Y polygon data obtained from from ImageJ. The polygon data are fed to predifined data structures for the geometric 
representation of fibre bundles (yarns). XML library is used to produce the final XML file. 
Polygon data files are saved as follows:
YarnType_Index_Slice.dat
